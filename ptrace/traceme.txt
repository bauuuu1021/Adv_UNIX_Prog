1. Observe the objdump of traceme, find that `8ab` might be the offset after function f()
2. Launch the program by `gdb ./traceme`
3. Find base address by `info proc mappings`
4. Set breakpoint by `base address + offset` (eg, b *0x00005555555548ab)
5. After the breakpoint is hit, print out the output by `p (char*)&output`
